Ample - little engine
=====================

In developing at the moment. I am so inspired, so you may check out Ample sources!

#### To install (Linux):

`$ ./ci/travis/install-linux.sh`

#### To run:
`$ ./build/what_is_ample`

#### What?
And press `b` to explode ice, `space` to slow down time. \
This is just an example of current powers of this engine.
You may run into main and change some parameters (can you create fire?).
This is not so powerful at this moment, but i am
doing my best :)
